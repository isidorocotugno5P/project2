# Rooftop Jumper 2D 8-Bit Resolution Game 

Welcome to Rooftop Jumper! A 2D 8-Bit style free online videogame using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for an interactive and responsive user experience. I was born in 1995 and had a bigger sister who was very into videogames, this was my inspiration for the game and the motivation to attempt something more complicated and complex than a simple rock, paper, scissors game or something similar. I grew up playing so many different kinds of 2D games, where all you could typically do was move in 4 directions, jump, duck, and maybe even fire off something or use items. Although I would have loved to incorporate all elements and made a fully completed game with an end goal, and even a background story, with my current knowledge I would have not managed that in the alloted time, so I stuck with the most (not-so-simple) simple functions. 

I must admit this was extremely challenging for me, and I have made way more mistakes in this project which resulted in far more bugs and complications than the last project, but the upside is, I learned more than I ever could have if I stuck with something simple. I hope you enjoy playing the game and are able to see the risk associated with something of this level with my current knowledge. I made sure to test extensively and vigorously to find all bugs I possibly pre and post deployment.

## Bugs

This game was incredibly difficult for me to code and it took an incredible amount of trial and error. In this section I would like to depict and display the bugs I successfully fixed but also attempt a deep dive into the bugs I could not or did not have time to fix but encountered through vigorous testing. Although some bugs were left unfixed, the testing taught me so much about how deployed websites present their own problems on different devices even if everything seemed fine in Google Devs. It taught me the importance of testing and that there is almost no such thing as too much testing as long as it has purpose. Trying this game out on different devices with different operating systems spiked my curiousity and showed me that long term testing platforms, designs, and code on as many systems and devices I can get my hands on will be crucial to a quality product.

## Future Features

1. Adding a double jump feature.
2. Adding a feature that detects how long you hold down the spacebar and that influences distance jumped, height jumped, or time jumped.
3. Adding flying obstacles and a ducking feature to create more variety. 
4. Adding in a death sequence sprite sheet for a death animation. 
5. Adding in other obstacles, such as monsters, that you can hit or shoot down with an attack animation.
6. Create a point system that adds points for every monster eliminated. 
7. Add a super sequence after x goal is reached like in Super Mario when he gets the golden mushroom.
8. Make game more challenging as time passes by increasing speed or increasing amount of crystals, monsters, obstacles, produced. 
9. Give the character the ability to move left and right to have more control over positioning.
10. Add a highscore count holder. 
11. Add a name input holder.

## Deployment

### Cloning Repository 

1. Go to project repository [here](https://github.com/isidorocotugno5P/project2)
2. Click on the green button labeled "Code" near the top right of the repository
3. Under the "Local" tab under the green button labeled "Code" copy the URL using HTTPS, make sure you are on the "HTTPS" beneath the "Local" tab of the green button labeled "<> Code"
4. You can choose to clone the repository with "SSH" or "GTIHub CLI" beneath the tabs labeled under each respective name
5. To copy each given URL click the copy button next to the URL under each given tab or highlight the URL itself and copy it directly. 
6. Open a terminal on your personal workspace on Github
7. Adapt and change the current working directory to the specific location where you would like your directory cloned
8. Into the terminal type in <code>git clone</code> and paste any of the URL you copied earlier
9. Press enter and your clone will be created

### Fork

1. Follow the previously given link to the given repository of this project
2. On the top right corner of the page you will see a dropdown button link labeled "Fork"
3. Press on it and you should see your own personal Github User ID assuming you have one
4. Click on your User ID to compute the fork
5. Now your browser should redirect you to the forked repository that should have been allocated in your own Github
6. Now if you view the dropdown button on the top right of your own Github organization labeled "Fork" the value should have increased by "1"
7. You have successfuly copied the original repository 

### Local Deployment

1. Once you have successfuly cloned or forked the repository it is time to locally deploy the website
2. Log into your own Github account, assuming that you have completed the previous steps you should have already had an account if you do not have an account please create one [here](https://github.com/). Once completed please follow the steps above for cloning or forking ideally before locally deploying the site.
3. Once you have made a clone or fork of your the linked repository above the repo should appear on the left hand side of your Github dashboard
4. Click on project repository
5. Click on the tabs labelled "Settings" to the right of the tab labelled "Insights"
6. On the left hand side of the Settings tab you will have to naviagte to the section called "Pages"
7. Once you have clicked on Pages you are going to have to set the "Source" to "Deploy from Branch", the "Main Branch", should be selected and the folder location has to be set to "/root"
8. Once all setting are set correctly press save and your website should be properly deployed
9. Return to the tab labelled "Code" on the same level you found the "Setting" tabs earlier, wait a few seconds or minutes, ideally refresh your repository, and your deployed website should be located on the right side of the repository under a section labelled "github-pages"
10. The given link should be an active link to your live website

### Python Webserver Port 

1. If you do not need a local deployment follow these steps in order to achieve a quick overview of the website
2. Once you have forked or cloned the linked repository, in your own github dashboard once you have clicked on the cloned or forked repository click on the green button labelled "Open" which will prompt your Github IDE workstation 
3. In the terminal type in <code>python3 -m http.server</code> to create a port
4. After a few seconds you should receive a pop up on the right of your workstation which will prompt you to make a choice on the deployed port. 
5. To view the current version of the coded website click on the button labelled "Open Browser"
6. This is the current version of the website that has been coded, changed, adapted, or altered on the current repository you have cloned or forked, any saved changed will be adapted on this version of the website before you <code>git push</code> the code and deploy the website
