# Rooftop Jumper 2D 8-Bit Resolution Game 

Welcome to Rooftop Jumper! A 2D 8-Bit style free online videogame using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for an interactive and responsive user experience. I was born in 1995 and had a bigger sister who was very into videogames, this was my inspiration for the game and the motivation to attempt something more complicated and complex than a simple rock, paper, scissors game or something similar. I grew up playing so many different kinds of 2D games, where all you could typically do was move in 4 directions, jump, duck, and maybe even fire off something or use items. Although I would have loved to incorporate all elements and made a fully completed game with an end goal, and even a background story, with my current knowledge I would have not managed that in the alloted time, so I stuck with the most (not-so-simple) simple functions. 

I must admit this was extremely challenging for me, and I have made way more mistakes in this project which resulted in far more bugs and complications than the last project, but the upside is, I learned more than I ever could have if I stuck with something simple. I hope you enjoy playing the game and are able to see the risk associated with something of this level with my current knowledge. I made sure to test extensively and vigorously to find all bugs I possibly pre and post deployment.

## User Stories 

### 1. User Story 1: Gameplay Mechanics

As a player, I want to be able to control the character’s jump by pressing a single button so that I can avoid obstacles (crystals) while running on the rooftop of the castle and aim for a high score.

- Acceptance Criteria:
  
  * The character should automatically run forward on the rooftop.
  * The player should be able to jump by pressing a single button.
  * The jump must be timed to avoid colliding with crystals, with the character’s height and distance of the jump being appropriate for gameplay.
  * Score should start counter once game starts.

- Key Tasks:

  * Implement the character's automatic forward movement on the rooftop.
  * Develop the single-button mechanic to trigger the jump (e.g., “space” key or by clicking a button).
  * Set jump mechanics to detect crystal collision (i.e., position, height, timing).
  * Implement a visual feedback system for the scoring mechanism.

### 2. User Story 2: Audio Control

As a player, I want to be able to toggle the in-game music on and off by pressing an icon so that I can adjust the game’s audio experience based on my preference.

- Acceptance Criteria:

  * A loudspeaker icon should be displayed on the game interface.
  * The icon should toggle between two states: music on (indicated by a full speaker) and music off (indicated by a muted speaker).
  * The background 8-bit music should be muted upon accessing the website.

- Key Tasks:

  * Design and implement the loudspeaker icon that toggles between two states.
  * Ensure the music does not start automatically when accessing the website for optimal user experience, also if the music is audible that it loops so it consistently plays without interruption.
  * Code the functionality so the icon toggles the music state when clicked.
  * Provide feedback to the player when the music is muted or playing (e.g., change icon appearance).

### 3. User Story 3: Visual Design & Theme

As a player, I want the game to have an engaging, cute medieval theme so that I feel immersed in the rooftop environment while playing.

- Acceptance Criteria:

  * The environment should feature an 8-bit castle rooftop with vibrant medieval-style visuals, such as flags and stone textures.
  * Crystals should be designed as obstacles in an 8-bit style, appearing at random intervals.
  * The character should have a charming, pixelated medieval character design.
  * The character animations should reflect the playful, lighthearted nature of the game.

- Key Tasks:

  * Design and implement a visually appealing 8-bit style rooftop background with a castle theme.
  * Create crystal obstacles in an 8-bit style.
  * Design a pixelated medieval character with simple animations (e.g., running, jumping).    
  * Test visual consistency to ensure all assets work together harmoniously.

### 4. User Story 4: Game Over Screen and Restart Option

As a player, I want to see a clear "Game Over" screen with the option to restart the game, so that I can immediately try again after losing with the final score displayed.

- Acceptance Criteria:

  * When the player collides with a crystal, a "Game Over" screen should appear.
  * The screen should display a "Try Again" button that allows the player to restart the game.
  * The "Game Over" screen should include a simple message such as “Game Over!” with the final score displayed to the user. 

- Key Tasks:

  * Design a "Game Over" screen with the final score displayed.
  * Implement logic to trigger the "Game Over" screen when a collision with a crystal occurs.
  * Add a "Try Again" button that resets the game and starts a new session.
  * Provide feedback to inform the player that the game has ended and they can start over.
  * Ensure the button resets the game to its initial state, including the score and character position.

### 5. User Story 5: Start Screen with Instructions and Game Explanation

As a player, I want to see a start screen with a brief explanation of the game, how to play, and a "Start" button, so that I understand the objective and controls before starting the game.

- Acceptance Criteria:
  
  * The start screen should clearly explain the objective of the game and how to play (e.g., jump over crystals to avoid them).
  * A button labeled "Start Game" should be visible, allowing the player to start the game when ready.
  * The screen should also include a simple set of instructions, such as “Press [Button] to Jump.”
  * The start screen design should match the medieval, cute 8-bit theme of the game.

- Key Tasks:

## Bugs

This game was incredibly difficult for me to code and it took an incredible amount of trial and error. In this section I would like to depict and display the bugs I successfully fixed but also attempt a deep dive into the bugs I could not or did not have time to fix but encountered through vigorous testing. Although some bugs were left unfixed, the testing taught me so much about how deployed websites present their own problems on different devices even if everything seemed fine in Google Devs. It taught me the importance of testing and that there is almost no such thing as too much testing as long as it has purpose. Trying this game out on different devices with different operating systems spiked my curiousity and showed me that long term testing platforms, designs, and code on as many systems and devices I can get my hands on will be crucial to a quality product. 

### Fixed Bugs

7. Add a super sequence after x goal is reached like in Super Mario when he gets the golden mushroom.
8. Make game more challenging as time passes by increasing speed or increasing amount of crystals, monsters, obstacles, produced. 
9. Give the character the ability to move left and right to have more control over positioning.
10. Add a highscore count holder. 
11. Add a name input holder.
12. More consistent placement of score and speaker throughout all different types of devices to not obstruct view/gameplay.
